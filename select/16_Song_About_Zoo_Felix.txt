T was all of our money
All of the money
All of the things that you
Hid on the backseat well,

We'll sell our children
Or hold them ransom
Someday we'll be back together again
And we'll,

Smother them softly
Hold out on emply
Take the car and the kids and go
Some place that cares and the,

Deer and the antelope
Watch as we both elope
In the brown envelopes
All that you care about
All that you care about
All alone
