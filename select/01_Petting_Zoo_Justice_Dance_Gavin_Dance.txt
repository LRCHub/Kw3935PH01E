I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
Black cat, brown rat
Face off vs. fruit bat
The greatest fight we've seen yet
Immaculate tact
Green clam, yellow lamb
Fight purple face ram
Bets are in, it's not a scam
Find out who wins
It's just an animal
Ass whoop, show
Puppy dog had an accident
Damn it, mammal
Kangaroo cracks its dick in half
The crowd sprayed crimson
Shark dad ate a baby calf
You still like burgers
Clip clop, clip clip clop
Horse comes out and beats your parents up
Going away, vacation
Going away, vacation
Vacation
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
Blue dog, red frog
Face off vs. big hog
Balancing on wet logs
Swamp bog, thick fog
Gray duck, white beaver
Fight golden retriever
One has meat cleaver
Nick named "Life Eater"
Get me out all your self-commendations
Don't face me now, I'd rather be blind to my malformations
Don't tell me I act like a child, I grew up in a basement
Practicing a smile, practicing a smile
Ride in the hammock with a bleeding fist
My white sides splitting like the ironic
Cucked little critter from the boards I sniff
Around on triggering the weeb racists
Both sides are shit, both sides are flipped
Ripped off the jaw of the idealist
Pick from one of any, fantasy pipe dreams
