[Intro]
Come on, get on up
We're wild and we can't be tamed
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
[Verse 1]
We live in a crazy world, caught up in a rat
race
Concrete jungle life is sometimes a mad place
It's you and me together at the end of a wild
day
Don't keep it all bottled up, and release your
energy
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, oh-ayy, only reason we are here is to
celebrate
In a place where anyone can be anything
Hold on to this moment, don't let it fade away
Baby, keep the music playin'
[Chorus]
Come on, get on up
We're wild and we can't be tamed
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Come on, keep it up
It's fun if you're down to play
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
[Post-Chorus]
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah (A zoo, ooh,
ooh)
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
[Verse 2]
We live in a heated time, no chance to cool down
Continuously confined, and what do we do now?
It's all about finding love, sometimes hard to
come by
But when it comes to us, it's always a good time
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, oh-ayy, only reason we are here is to
celebrate
In a place where anyone can be anything
Hold on to this moment, don't let it fade away
Baby, keep the music playin'
[Chorus]
Come on, get on up
We're wild and we can't be tamed
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Come on, keep it up
It's fun if you're down to play
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
[Post-Chorus]
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah (A zoo, ooh,
ooh)
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah (A zoo, ooh,
ooh)
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah (A zoo, ooh,
ooh)
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
Hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, hop-ah, ah (A zoo, ooh,
ooh)
Hop-ah, hop-ah, oh
[Bridge]
I'll take you higher, I'll take you higher
We can't be tamed, baby, I'll take you higher
I'll take you higher, I'll take you higher
And we can't be tamed, baby, I'll take you
higher
Es una fiesta que sube como la espuma
Yo por ti iré hasta la luna de ida y vuelta
Es una fiesta que sube como la espuma
Yo por ti iré hasta la luna de ida y vuelta
[Chorus]
Come on, get on up
We're wild and we can't be tamed
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Come on, keep it up
It's fun if you're down to play
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Come on, get on up
We're wild and we can't be tamed
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
Come on, keep it up
It's fun if you're down to play
And we're turnin' the floor into
A zoo, ooh, ooh
