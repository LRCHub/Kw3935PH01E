[01:00.37] I'm ready
[01:02.65] I'm ready for the laughing gas
[01:08.06] I'm ready
[01:10.27] I'm ready for what's next
[01:15.05] I'm ready to duck
[01:16.76] I'm ready to dive

[01:22.33] I'm ready
[01:25.35] I'm ready for the push
[01:36.35] 
[01:29.74] In the cool of the night
[01:33.38] In the warmth of the breeze
[01:37.13] I'll be crawling around
[01:40.62] On my hands and knees
[01:51.12]

[02:10.53] To take it to the street
[02:15.22] Ready for the shuffle
[02:17.11] Ready for the deal
[02:18.99] Ready to let go
[02:20.42] Of the steering wheel
[02:22.13] I'm ready
[02:25.57] Ready for the crush
[02:35.07] 
[02:46.65] Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

[03:05.39] 
[03:07.60] Time is a train
[03:10.83] Makes the future the past
[03:14.96] Leaves you standing in the station
[03:18.16] Your face pressed up against the glass
[03:37.16] 
[03:22.69] I'm just down the line from your love, Zoo Station
[03:30.02] I'm under the sign of your love, Zoo Station
[03:38.48] I'm gonna make it on time, make it on time, Zoo Station
[04:05.98] 
[03:42.88] Just two stops down the line, Zoo Station
[03:45.46] Just a stop down the line, Zoo Station
